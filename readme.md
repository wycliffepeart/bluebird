## Bluebird Java Application

Bluebird is a desktop application base on a project that was given in my second year,
semester three at the University of Technology. The aim of the project is to test our
understanding of Object Oriented Programing (OOP) and our ability to implement this
approach when developing applications. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming
paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which may contain data, in the form of fields,
often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. 
Some of the concepts covered over the semester include but not limited to:

#### **Encapsulation**

The first pillar of object-oriented programming is encapsulation . The idea behind
encapsulation is that you want to keep each type or class discreet and self-contained.
This allows you to change the implementation of one class without affecting any other class. 

#### **(Inheritance) Specialization and Generalization**
The second pillar, specialization, is implemented by declaring that a new class
derives from an existing class. When you do so, the specialized class inherits the 
characteristics of the more general class. The specialized class is called a derived class,
while the more general class is known as a base class.

#### **Polymorphism**
Polymorphism, the third pillar of object-oriented programming, is closely related to
inheritance. The prefix poly means many; morph means form. Thus, polymorphism refers to the ability of a single type or class to take many forms.

## The Application
This application was develop using Java 10 and JavaFx to design a beautiful user interface, and to add 
user interactions. Some of the features include but not limited to user login, user registration, [SqLite](http://www.sqlitetutorial.net/) for storing data and more.
